How could having easy access to the entire history of a file
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

to those files if you have any troubles with the code that you
are working on at the moment.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing
when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having
versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

When manually creating a commit, you can choose a logical to
create a commit in order to keep it simple when you need to
go back to a commit. But you have a chance of forgetting to
create one and ends up in a big commit or lost data. On the 
other hand, creating it automatically makes it unforgettable,
but it's not saved in a logical order and can lead to confusion.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow
saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google
Docs, trea each file separately? 

Because it is important to take in consideration changes from
more than one file beauce changes can occur over multiple
files to fix an error.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the 
history of files?

You can use it to view history file because you have access to
the full commits in the git log and afterwards you can compare
two files using git diff.
