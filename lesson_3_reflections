When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

It is interesting to use a remote repository when your are working on a project
with someone else because it's easier to share your files that way.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I would want to pull changes manually because if i'm not done with the code
that I wrote on Github I don't want to interfer with the current working
code in my local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

I would use forks when i'm getting the data from someone else's repository
but i would use clone when I don't need to modify anything on the original
code. Branches are useful when I'm trying something out on my current code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

Having a copy of the last remote stored locally is important because you can
see what has been done in the code and don't have to do the same work that
has already been made.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

Without using Git or GitHub, I would send a ip file everytime I make a
change on the code but it would be hard to merge what we do at the same
time.
