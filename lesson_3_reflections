When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local?

It is interesting to use a remote repository when your are working on a project
with someone else because it's easier to share your files that way.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I would want to pull changes manually because if i'm not done with the code
that I wrote on Github I don't want to interfer with the current working
code in my local repository.
